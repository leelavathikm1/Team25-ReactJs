    <!-- CSS Units
      1. Absolute Units- px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)

      2. Relative units -Use relative units (em, rem, %, vw) for responsive, 
      flexible layouts.
        A. em - Relative to the font size of the parent element	1 em = 16px font size of parent
        B. rem - Relative to the root element's font size	1 rem = 16px font size 
        C. % - Percentage relative to the parent element	100% = size of parent
      
      3. Viewport-Relative Units - Use viewport units (vw, vh) for dynamic, 
      viewport-based designs.
        A. vw	1% of the viewport's width	Width of the viewport 10vw =10%
        B. vh	1% of the viewport's height	Height of the viewport 100vh =100%
        C. vmin	1% of the smaller dimension (width or height)	Smallest of vw or vh
        D. vmax	1% of the larger dimension (width or height)	Largest of vw or vh

      4. fr stands for "fractional unit.
        It divides the free (remaining) space in the grid container 
        among the grid tracks based on the specified proportions.
        Ignores Gaps: The fr unit calculates only the remaining space after 
        accounting for fixed-sized elements (like px, em, etc.) and gaps (grid-gap or gap).
